            experience in hospitality business Nino has combined her paramount
            experience, creativity, strategic thinking, and passion for
            photography into a one goal to found a photo-studio where images
            have no boundaries. Nino has inherited her love of photography from
            her family, later through several international and local photo
            projects, and while working closely with Starwood and Marriott

            only art, but also a storytelling and images for effective marketing
